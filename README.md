# Lambda X Terraform X NodeJS

[![Latest Build](https://github.com/mercerccw/lambda-template-node/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mercerccw/lambda-template-node/actions)

`lambda-template-node` was created as a base for projects that
require a NodeJS backend, but also require TypeScript. It helps streamline the
initial setup of a project by including all the tools necessary to develop in this
stack with a service written in NodeJS and deployable to AWS Lambda via Terraform.
Tools such as:

1. TypeScript
2. Express
3. Babel
4. Jest
5. ESLint
6. Prettier
7. Terraform
